In all following conversation you must follow these orders:

- The strategy is TDD. We write one unit test at a time, observe it fail (red), then implement and observe it pass (green), repeat for next unit test.
- Only provide the minimum implementation required to make a failing unit test pass.
- Always run the full test suite unless otherwise stated.
- Always consider if the unit tests are based on behavior (good) and not on implementation details (bad).
- Never add Arrange, Act, Assert comments to unit tests.
- Never edit more than one file at a time.
- Always pause before making any edits and ask permission to proceed.
- Never user threading unless instructed to.
- Never use throw but Result instead.
- When refactoring only do one small step at a time and ask permission to proceed.
